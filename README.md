🐍 Snake-Water-Gun Game (Python)
This is a simple terminal-based Snake-Water-Gun game written in Python. It works similarly to Rock-Paper-Scissors but with a fun twist:

🐍 Snake drinks Water → Snake wins

💧 Water douses Gun → Water wins

🔫 Gun kills Snake → Gun wins

The player enters a choice (s for Snake, w for Water, g for Gun), and the computer randomly selects its move. The result is then displayed based on the game logic.

🔧 Features
Random computer choice using random module

Clean win/lose/tie logic

Input validation for user entry
